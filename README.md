#  Spaced-Repetition
We often face this problem, whilst interview preparation after solving a particular coding problem and also understanding it as well, what happens after few days is that
we **forget** the approach of the problem and are back to square one. This problem happens when we are not revising the concepts or problems well, this extension is built to solve
this particular problem only.
  
> ###Repetition is the mother of learning.

Based on above concept this chrome extension is built. To have an edge while preparing for coding interviews in the tech company this repetition technique brilliantly does its job well.

User can store the links of coding problems he identifies is important to revise in the future and add it into today's list. That same link that user added into the list will be shown to user repetitively in the future at least 10 more times after which the link will be deleted from the revision list(he can access all of his links by downloading the csv).

The repetition of the same question/link in the future will solidify the concepts, understanding and techniques of the user to solve the problem better and more efficent.

After repeating 10 times in the future the link you stored will be deleted to make room for new revision links fo you to revise.
**Important: Resetting will delete all of your links so please download the csv before hand otherwise you will lose all your links.**
